# GitLab Geo database replication

>**Note:**
This is the documentation for installations from source. For installations
using the Omnibus GitLab packages, follow the
[**database replication for Omnibus GitLab**](database.md) guide.

>**Note:**
Stages of the setup process must be completed in the documented order.
Before attempting the steps in this stage, complete all prior stages.

1. [Install GitLab Enterprise Edition][install-ee-source] on the server that
   will serve as the **secondary** Geo node. Do not login or set up anything
   else in the secondary node for the moment.
1. [Upload the GitLab License](../user/admin_area/license.md) you purchased for GitLab Enterprise Edition to unlock GitLab Geo.
1. **Setup the database replication topology** (`primary (read-write) <-> secondary (read-only)`)
1. [Configure SSH authorizations to use the database](ssh.md)
1. [Configure GitLab](configuration_source.md) to set the primary and secondary
   nodes.
1. [Follow the after setup steps](after_setup.md).

[install-ee-source]: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/install/installation.html "GitLab Enterprise Edition installation from source"

This document describes the minimal steps you have to take in order to
replicate your GitLab database into another server. You may have to change
some values according to your database setup, how big it is, etc.

You are encouraged to first read through all the steps before executing them
in your testing/production environment.

## PostgreSQL replication

The GitLab primary node where the write operations happen will connect to
primary database server, and the secondary ones which are read-only will
connect to secondary database servers (which are read-only too).

>**Note:**
In many databases documentation you will see "primary" being referenced as "master"
and "secondary" as either "slave" or "standby" server (read-only).

Since GitLab 9.4: We recommend using [PostgreSQL replication
slots](https://medium.com/@tk512/replication-slots-in-postgresql-b4b03d277c75)
to ensure the primary retains all the data necessary for the secondaries to
recover. See below for more details.

### Prerequisites

The following guide assumes that:

- You are using PostgreSQL 9.6 or later which includes the [`pg_basebackup` tool][pgback].
- You have a primary server already set up (the GitLab server you are
  replicating from), and you have a new secondary server set up on the same OS
  and PostgreSQL version. Also make sure the GitLab version is the same on all nodes.
- The IP of the primary server for our examples will be `1.2.3.4`, whereas the
  secondary's IP will be `5.6.7.8`. Note that the primary and secondary servers
  **must** be able to communicate over these addresses. These IP addresses can either
  be public or private.

### Step 1. Configure the primary server

1. SSH into your GitLab **primary** server and login as root:

    ```
    sudo -i
    ```

1. Create a replication user named `gitlab_replicator`:

    ```bash
    sudo -u postgres psql -c "CREATE USER gitlab_replicator REPLICATION ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'thepassword';"
    ```

1. Set up TLS support for the PostgreSQL primary server
    > **Warning**: Only skip this step if you **know** that PostgreSQL traffic
    > between the primary and secondary will be secured through some other
    > means, e.g., a known-safe physical network path or a site-to-site VPN that
    > you have configured.

    If you are replicating your database across the open Internet, it is
    **essential** that the connection is TLS-secured. Correctly configured, this
    provides protection against both passive eavesdroppers and active
    "man-in-the-middle" attackers.

    To do this, PostgreSQL needs to be provided with a key and certificate to
    use. You can re-use the same files you're using for your main GitLab
    instance, or generate a self-signed certificate just for PostgreSQL's use.

    Prefer the first option if you already have a long-lived certificate. Prefer
    the second if your certificates expire regularly (e.g. LetsEncrypt), or if
    PostgreSQL is running on a different server to the main GitLab services
    (this may be the case in a HA configuration, for instance).

    To generate a self-signed certificate and key, run this command:

    ```bash
    openssl req -nodes -batch -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout server.key -out server.crt -days 3650
    ```

    This will create two files - `server.key` and `server.crt` - that you can
    use for authentication.

    PostgreSQL's permission requirements are very strict, so whether you're
    re-using your certificates or just generated new ones, **copy** the files
    to the correct location. Do check that the destination path below is
    correct!

    If you're re-using certificates already in GitLab, they are likely to be in
    the `/etc/ssl` directory. If your domain is `primary.geo.example.com`, the
    commands would be:

    ```bash
    # Copying a certificate and key currently used by GitLab
    install -o postgres -g postgres -m 0400 -T /etc/ssl/certs/primary.geo.example.com.crt ~postgres/9.x/main/data/server.crt
    install -o postgres -g postgres -m 0400 -T /etc/ssl/private/primary.geo.example.com.key ~postgres/9.x/main/data/server.key
    ```

    If you just generated a self-signed certificate and key, the files will be
    in your current working directory, so run:

    ```bash
    # Copying a self-signed certificate and key
    install -o postgres -g postgres -m 0400 -T server.crt ~postgres/9.x/main/data/server.crt
    install -o postgres -g postgres -m 0400 -T server.key ~postgres/9.x/main/data/server.key
    ```

    Add this configuration to `postgresql.conf`, removing any existing
    configuration for `ssl_cert_file` or `ssl_key_file`:

    ```
    ssl = on
    ssl_cert_file='server.crt'
    ssl_key_file='server.key'
    ```

1. Edit `postgresql.conf` to configure the primary server for streaming replication
   (for Debian/Ubuntu that would be `/etc/postgresql/9.x/main/postgresql.conf`):

    ```
    listen_address = '1.2.3.4'
    wal_level = hot_standby
    max_wal_senders = 5
    min_wal_size = 80MB
    max_wal_size = 1GB
    max_replicaton_slots = 1 # Number of Geo secondary nodes
    wal_keep_segments = 10
    hot_standby = on
    ```

    Be sure to set `max_replication_slots` to the number of Geo secondary
    nodes that you may potentially have (at least 1).

    For security reasons, PostgreSQL by default only listens on the local
    interface (e.g. 127.0.0.1). However, GitLab Geo needs to communicate
    between the primary and secondary nodes over a common network, such as a
    corporate LAN or the public Internet. For this reason, we need to
    configure PostgreSQL to listen on more interfaces.

    The `listen_address` option opens PostgreSQL up to external connections
    with the interface corresponding to the given IP. See [the PostgreSQL
    documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/runtime-config-connection.html)
    for more details.

    You may also want to edit the `wal_keep_segments` and `max_wal_senders` to
    match your database replication requirements. Consult the [PostgreSQL - Replication documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/runtime-config-replication.html)
    for more information.

1. Set the access control on the primary to allow TCP connections using the
   server's public IP and set the connection from the secondary to require a
   password.  Edit `pg_hba.conf` (for Debian/Ubuntu that would be
   `/etc/postgresql/9.x/main/pg_hba.conf`):

    ```bash
    host    all             all                      127.0.0.1/32    trust
    host    all             all                      1.2.3.4/32      trust
    host    replication     gitlab_replicator        5.6.7.8/32      md5
    ```

    Where `1.2.3.4` is the public IP address of the primary server, and `5.6.7.8`
    the public IP address of the secondary one. If you want to add another
    secondary, add one more row like the replication one and change the IP
    address:

      ```bash
      host    all             all                      127.0.0.1/32    trust
      host    all             all                      1.2.3.4/32      trust
      host    replication     gitlab_replicator        5.6.7.8/32      md5
      host    replication     gitlab_replicator        11.22.33.44/32  md5
      ```

1. Restart PostgreSQL for the changes to take effect.

1. Choose a database-friendly name to use for your secondary to use as the
   replication slot name. For example, if your domain is
   `geo-secondary.mydomain.com`, you may use `geo_secondary_my_domain_com` as
   the slot name.

1. Create the replication slot on the primary:

     ```
     $ sudo -u postgres psql -c "SELECT * FROM pg_create_physical_replication_slot('geo_secondary_my_domain');"
           slot_name             | xlog_position
        -------------------------+---------------
         geo_secondary_my_domain |
        (1 row)
     ```

1. Now that the PostgreSQL server is set up to accept remote connections, run
   `netstat -plnt` to make sure that PostgreSQL is listening to the server's
   public IP.

### Step 2. Add the secondary GitLab node

To prevent the secondary geo node trying to act as the primary once the
database is replicated, the secondary geo node must be configured on the
primary before the database is replicated.

1. Visit the **primary** node's **Admin Area âž” Geo Nodes**
   (`/admin/geo_nodes`) in your browser.
1. Add the secondary node by providing its full URL. **Do NOT** check the box
   'This is a primary node'.
1. Added in GitLab 9.5: Choose which namespaces should be replicated by the
   secondary node. Leave blank to replicate all. Read more in
   [selective replication](#selective-replication).
1. Click the **Add node** button.

### Step 3. Configure the secondary server

1. SSH into your GitLab **secondary** server and login as root:

    ```
    sudo -i
    ```

1. Test that the remote connection to the primary server works:

    ```
    sudo -u postgres psql -h 1.2.3.4 -U gitlab_replicator -d gitlabhq_production -W
    ```

    When prompted enter the password you set in the first step for the
    `gitlab_replicator` user. If all worked correctly, you should see the
    database prompt.

1. Exit the PostgreSQL console:

    ```
    \q
    ```

1. Edit `postgresql.conf` to configure the secondary for streaming replication
   (for Debian/Ubuntu that would be `/etc/postgresql/9.*/main/postgresql.conf`):

    ```bash
    wal_level = hot_standby
    max_wal_senders = 5
    checkpoint_segments = 10
    wal_keep_segments = 10
    hot_standby = on
    ```

1. Restart PostgreSQL for the changes to take effect.

1. Optional since GitLab 9.1, and required for GitLab 10.0 or higher:
   [Enable tracking database on the secondary server](#enable-tracking-database-on-the-secondary-server)

1. Otherwise, continue to [initiate the replication process](#step-3-initiate-the-replication-process).

#### Enable tracking database on the secondary server

Geo secondary nodes use a tracking database to keep track of replication status and recover
automatically from some replication issues.

It is added in GitLab 9.1, and since GitLab 10.0 it is required.

> **IMPORTANT:** For this feature to work correctly, all nodes must be
with their clocks synchronized. It is not required for all nodes to be set to
the same time zone, but when the respective times are converted to UTC time,
the clocks must be synchronized to within 60 seconds of each other.

1. Setup clock synchronization service in your Linux distro.
   This can easily be done via any NTP-compatible daemon. For example,
   here are [instructions for setting up NTP with Ubuntu](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/NTP.html).

1. Create `database_geo.yml` with the information of your secondary PostgreSQL
   database.  Note that GitLab will set up another database instance separate
   from the primary, since this is where the secondary will track its internal
   state:

    ```
    sudo cp /home/git/gitlab/config/database_geo.yml.postgresql /home/git/gitlab/config/database_geo.yml
    ```

1. Edit the content of `database_geo.yml` in `production:` like the example below:

     ```yaml
     #
     # PRODUCTION
     #
     production:
       adapter: postgresql
       encoding: unicode
       database: gitlabhq_geo_production
       pool: 10
       username: gitlab_geo
       # password:
       host: /var/opt/gitlab/geo-postgresql
     ```

1. Create the database `gitlabhq_geo_production` in that PostgreSQL
   instance.

1. Set up the Geo tracking database:

    ```
    bundle exec rake geo:db:migrate
    ```

### Step 4. Initiate the replication process

Below we provide a script that connects to the primary server, replicates the
database and creates the needed files for replication.

The directories used are the defaults for Debian/Ubuntu. If you have changed
any defaults, configure it as you see fit replacing the directories and paths.

>**Warning:**
Make sure to run this on the **secondary** server as it removes all PostgreSQL's
data before running `pg_basebackup`.

1. SSH into your GitLab **secondary** server and login as root:

    ```
    sudo -i
    ```

1. Set up PostgreSQL TLS verification on the secondary
    If you configured the PostgreSQL to accept TLS connections in
    [Step 1][#step-1-configure-the-primary-server], then you need to provide a
    list of "known-good" certificates to the secondary. It uses this list to
    keep the connection secure against an active "man-in-the-middle" attack.

    If you reused your existing certificates on the primary, you can use the
    list of valid root certificates provided with your distribution. For
    Debian/Ubuntu, they can be found in `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`:

    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~postgres/.postgresql
    ln -s /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt ~postgres/.postgresql/root.crt
    ```

    If you generated a self-signed certificate, that won't work. Copy the
    generated `server.crt` file onto the secondary server from the primary, then
    install it in the right place:

    ```bash
    install -o postgres -g postgres -m 0400 -T server.crt ~postgres/.postgresql/root.crt
    ```

    PostgreSQL will now only recognize that exact certificate when verifying TLS
    connections.


1. Save the snippet below in a file, let's say `/tmp/replica.sh`. Modify the
   embedded paths if necessary:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    PORT="5432"
    USER="gitlab_replicator"
    echo ---------------------------------------------------------------
    echo WARNING: Make sure this script is run from the secondary server
    echo ---------------------------------------------------------------
    echo
    echo Enter the IP or FQDN of the primary PostgreSQL server
    read HOST
    echo Enter the password for $USER@$HOST
    read -s PASSWORD
    echo Enter the required sslmode
    read SSLMODE

    echo Stopping PostgreSQL and all GitLab services
    gitlab-ctl stop

    echo Backing up postgresql.conf
    sudo -u postgres mv /var/opt/gitlab/postgresql/data/postgresql.conf /var/opt/gitlab/postgresql/

    echo Cleaning up old cluster directory
    sudo -u postgres rm -rf /var/opt/gitlab/postgresql/data
    rm -f /tmp/postgresql.trigger

    echo Starting base backup as the replicator user
    echo Enter the password for $USER@$HOST
    sudo -u postgres /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/pg_basebackup -h $HOST -D /var/opt/gitlab/postgresql/data -U gitlab_replicator -v -x -P

    echo Writing recovery.conf file
    sudo -u postgres bash -c "cat > /var/opt/gitlab/postgresql/data/recovery.conf <<- _EOF1_
      standby_mode = 'on'
      primary_conninfo = 'host=$HOST port=$PORT user=$USER password=$PASSWORD sslmode=$SSLMODE'
      trigger_file = '/tmp/postgresql.trigger'
    _EOF1_
    "

    echo Restoring postgresql.conf
    sudo -u postgres mv /var/opt/gitlab/postgresql/postgresql.conf /var/opt/gitlab/postgresql/data/

    echo Starting PostgreSQL and all GitLab services
    gitlab-ctl start
    ```

1. Run it with:

    ```
    bash /tmp/replica.sh
    ```

    When prompted, enter the IP/FQDN of the primary, and the password you set up
    for the `gitlab_replicator` user in the first step. If you are re-using
    existing certificates and connecting to an FQDN, use `verify-full` for the
    `sslmode`.

    If you have to connect to a specific IP address, rather than the FQDN of the
    primary, to reach your PostgreSQL server, then you should use `verify-ca`
    for the `sslmode` instead. This should **only** be the case if you have
    also used a self-signed certificate. `verify-ca` is **not** safe if you are
    connecting to an IP address and re-using an existing TLS certificate!

    Use `prefer` if you are happy to skip PostgreSQL TLS
    authentication altogether (e.g., you know the network path is secure, or you
    are using a site-to-site VPN).

    You can read more details about each `sslmode` in the
    [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/libpq-ssl.html#LIBPQ-SSL-PROTECTION);
    the instructions above are carefully written to ensure protection against
    both passive eavesdroppers and active "man-in-the-middle" attackers.

The replication process is now over.
